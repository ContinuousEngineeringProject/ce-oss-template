## Unit Testing
Unit tests are used to verify the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated. They are written in a way that allows for the codebase to be tested in isolation. Additions, changes, and fixes should be accompanied by new or updated unit tests.

## Feature Testing
Feature tests are used to verify the functionality of the codebase. Additions, changes, and fixes should be accompanied by new or updated integration tests.

## End-to-end testing
End-to-end tests are used to verify the behaviour of the codebase. Additions, changes, and fixes should be accompanied by new or updated end-to-end tests.
